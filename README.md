# Word Cloud using Python

A word cloud is not just a basic visualization of text data. In the field of data science, it serves a significant purpose in analyzing data derived from various applications. Essentially, a word cloud represents words or tags in a graphical manner that depicts the frequency of entities within a specific dataset.

Data scientists commonly use word clouds to visually showcase the most commonly occurring words within a dataset. These words are represented in various sizes and colors, based on their frequency, which helps to identify keywords of importance.

In order to generate a word cloud using Python, we will utilize data from the Google Play Store reviews, which can be easily downloaded.
